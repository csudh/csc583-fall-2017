# Software Engineering Processes

Welcome to CSC 583.  According to [Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/courses/413/), software engineering is:

> The branch of computer science that creates practical, cost-effective solutions to computing and information processing problems, preferentially by applying scientific knowledge, developing software systems in the service of mankind.  

This course covers the fundamentals of software engineering, including understanding system requirements, finding appropriate engineering compromises, effective methods of design, coding, and testing, team software development, and the application of engineering tools.  In summary, this course presents an in-depth study of the issues related to software engineering processes.   

Please refer to the [syllabus](SYLLABUS.md) for more information on the administrative guideline.
